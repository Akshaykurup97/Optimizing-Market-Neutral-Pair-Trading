This project report presents an innovative pair trading strategy that integrates the 
Engle-Granger cointegration test on returns with sophisticated portfolio optimization 
constraints. The strategy's goal is to exploit inefficiencies in stock pairs' price 
relationships. By employing the Engle-Granger cointegration test, we identify stocks 
with a long-term equilibrium in pricing behavior. After stock selection, a robust 
portfolio optimization algorithm ascertains optimal investment weights for each stock 
pair, aiming to maximize returns while sustaining a market-neutral position, thus 
reducing exposure to general market swings. Additionally, this strategy strives to 
construct multiple portfolios of individual pairs with very low portfolio standard 
deviations, finding weights that counterbalance each other (one long, one short).
